    "* The weak positive correlation of 0.39 between temperature and the number of bikes rented suggests that, on average, fewer people prefer to use electric cycles during the daytime between 12 PM to 3 PM. This observation aligns with our univariate analysis, where we discovered that the average number of cycles rented during this time frame was lower compared to other times of the day. A similar correlation pattern is also observed in the case of \"feels-like\" temperature, reinforcing this trend.\n",
    "* The negative correlation between humidity and the number of cycles rented indicates that people tend to avoid using electric bikes during high humidity conditions. This avoidance can be attributed to the discomfort caused by the heavy and sticky air, leading to sweating and a general sense of unease. Moreover, the reduced efficiency of electric bikes in high humidity, resulting in increased air resistance and potential battery performance issues, contributes to the preference for alternative transportation or indoor activities in such conditions.\n",
    "* The presence of a weak positive correlation between windspeed and the number of cycles rented indicates that there is a subset of individuals who appear to favor using electric cycles during windy conditions for the sheer enjoyment of the experience. While this preference contributes to a slight increase in bike rentals on windier days, it's essential to recognize that this effect is not particularly strong, as indicated by the weak correlation. This suggests that the enjoyment of cycling in windy conditions is a relatively niche preference among riders."

    "* On working days, 68.1% of cycles are rented, whereas on non-working days, 31.9% of cycles are rented.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Despite the fact that 68.1% of cycles are rented on working days compared to 31.9% on non-working days, our t-test analysis does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that working days have a significant effect on the number of cycles rented. This finding suggests that there is no statistically significant difference in the number of cycles rented between working days and non-working days.\n",
    "\n",
    "* During the fall, summer and winter seasons approximately 25.1% of cycles were rented(respectively).\n",
    "* The lowest rental rate(In comparison with other seasons), 24.7% of cycles were rented,is observed in the spring season.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ANOVA test results indicate a clear and statistically significant difference in the mean number of cycles rented across all seasons. This underscores the notion that the season plays a substantial role in influencing the number of bikes rented.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Weather condition 1, they experiences the highest rental rate, with approximately 66% of cycles rented.\n",
    "* In weather condition 2, around 26.0% of cycles were rented.\n",
    "* Weather condition 3 has a rental rate of approximately 7.9 % for cycles.\n",
    "* Weather condition 4 exhibits an exceptionally low rental rate, with only 0.0% of cycles being rented(In count 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ANOVA test results indicate a significant difference in the mean number of cycles rented across all weather conditions, which strongly suggests that weather types have a significant effect on the number of cycles rented.\n",
    "* The chi-square test results reveal a statistically significant association between weather type and the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The highest average count of rental bikes is observed at 5 PM, closely followed by 5 PM and 7 AM. This indicates distinct peak hours during the day when cycling is most popular.\n",
    "* Conversely, the lowest average count of rental bikes occurs at 4 AM, with 3 AM and 5 AM also showing low counts. These hours represent the early morning period with the least demand for cycling. Notably, there is an increasing trend in cycle rentals between 5 AM and 8 AM, suggesting a surge in demand during the early morning hours as people start their day.\n",
    "* Additionally, there is a decreasing trend in cycle rentals from 5 PM to 11 PM, indicating a gradual decline in demand as the day progresses into the evening and nighttime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The highest average hourly count of rental bikes occurs in June, July, and August, reflecting the peak demand during summer season.\n",
    "* Conversely, the lowest average hourly count of rental bikes is found in January, February, and March, which are the winter months with reduced cycling activity.\n",
    "* Notably, there is an increasing trend in average bike rentals from February to June, corresponding to the shift from winter to spring and summer. \n",
    "* Conversely, a decreasing trend in average bike rentals is observed from October to December due to the onset of winter.\n"

    "# **RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In summer,fall,and winter seasons the company should have more bikes in stock. Because the demand in these seasons is higher than spring(but not that much lower).\n",
    "- When weather is 1 i.e Clear, Few clouds, partly cloudy, partly cloudy most of the bikes were rented.So for this weather we\n",
    "have high sales and demand whcih need not to be compromised so we need to increase the stock so that i will be available for all the\n",
    "customers.\n",
    "- Whenever temperature is less than 10 or in very cold days, company should have less bikes.\n",
    "- People love to cycle when the atemperate is between 20 to 35.\n",
    "- In very low humidity days, company should have less bikes in the stock to be rented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whenever the windspeed is greater than 35 or in thunderstorms, company should have less bikes in stock as it is least to be rented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we observe The lowest average count of rental bikes occurs from 1 am to 4 am.so we can capitalize this time for the cycle repair if needed,maintenance and the charging so to increase the operational efficiency\n",
    "- After maintenance and charging, strategically deploy bikes to high-demand areas in preparation for the morning rush.\n",
    "- Ensure that bikes are available at key locations, such as transportation hubs, offices, and residential areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- During the seasons with adverse weather conditions, such as rain or snow, Yulu can provide weather-ready bikes equipped with features like fenders and all-weather tires or anti skid tyres.\n",
    "- This ensures that riders are comfortable and safe during inclement weather.\n"
